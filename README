==== Prerequirement: TetMeshLib ====
Download TetMeshLib, and add it in the contrib/ directory (contrib/TetMeshLib/)
Build this library (it require several tools, i.e. gmake, makedepend, etc.):
 - "cd contrib/TetMeshLib"
 - if you are in an Unix system, please rename "include/tetface.h" as "include/TetFace.h"
 - if you're using a 64 bits system, please add "-DIS64BITPLATFORM" CFLAGS in "src/Makefile"
 - "make"
Notes:
 - the compilation may not works with recent g++ version. Please edit CheckAndRepair.cpp, and rename in line 176 and following the variable "or" (by using for example "or_")
 - the compilation may not works on 64 bits systems. Please modify the following lines:
   - in "TetMesh.cpp", line 423, 424, 425, replace "(int)" by "(j_voidint)"

==== Compilation ====
The compilation of OC3D is performed using cmake (see http://www.cmake.org/):
 - create a directory build/
 - "cd build/"
 - "ccmake .." to check for dependancies
 - "make" will build all the binaries

 - the compilation may not works on 64 bits systems. Please modify the following lines (may not works perfectly, it's just a workaround):
   - in "IO_Tet.h", line 77, replace "(int)" by "(long int)"
